## Artificial Intelligence Residency Program

<br> 

The **main objective of the AI HUB Senai Londrina** is to promote the adoption of this technology by the Brazilian industry in its different domains. The AI Hub is located in the Londrina-Maringá axis, in southern Brazil, where a concentration of over 2000 IT companies, highly qualified professionals and well positioned universities interact in an innovative way to bring solutions to real world problems.

The Residency Program has 20 postgraduate students from the fields of engineering, computing, mathematics and physics and aims to meet the demands of the program's funding companies.

<br> 

**The applied projects include the following areas of Data Science and AI:**

**- foundations of Data Science:** development environment management, python programming, data type handling, data manipulation and data transformation, control structures, file manipulation, classes and objects, processing and threading, python for data science using APIs such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, dataframe manipulation, grapho programming, descriptive and predictive statistics, sampling methods, Bayes theorem, probability distributions and various hypothesis tests;

**- data analysis:** data visualization, exploratory analysis, graphical communication using matplotlib and plotly, data acquisition and data wrangling for data science, web scraping, sql and nosql programming, preprocessing techniques, descriptive analysis, variance analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, normalization and time series analysis, statistical learning, parametric and nonparametric multivariate modeling, machine learning model selection and model evaluation, cross-validation, bootstrap methods;

**- applied data science:** binary and multi-class classification and grouping algorithms, data regularization, multi-order supervised and unsupervised methods (logistic regression, coefficient estimation, LDA, decision trees, boosting, random forests, SVM, K-means, KNN and related algorithms), search methods, heuristic methods, automatic reasoning, solution planning and engineering, multi-layer perceptrons, learning algorithms, backpropagation algorithms, activation functions, coding and output layers, architecture neural networks, learning parameter optimization, optimization functions using tensorflow and keras, CNN, RNN, generative models and deep learning;
